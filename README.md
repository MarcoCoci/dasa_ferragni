In our project folder, you will find four distinct Python scripts: one for interfacing with the Reddit API, one for scraping articles, one for cleaning the dataset and standardizing the format, and one for performing sentiment analysis.
  Additionally, the folder contains three datasets: one with all data excluding emojis, one with all data including emojis, and one with the results of our sentiment analysis.
  The accompanying report provides a comprehensive overview of our methodology, the processes we undertook, and the outcomes of our analysis.
  The requirements section lists all the libraries needed to run the scripts.
The zip folder “dashboard” contains everything needed to run the dashboard we showcased during the pitch
